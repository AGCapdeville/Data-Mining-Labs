    Different methods to handle missing data in machine learning:

1. Deductive Imputation:
    Imputation rule defined by logical reasoning, as opposed to a statistical rule.
    For example, if a person has $10 in their bank on March 5th, and then the bank
    is missing data for March 6th but has record of that person having $10 on March 7th.
    We can reasonably impute that they have $10 in their bank on March 7th

2. Mean/Median/Mode Imputation:
    In this method, any missing values in a given column are replaced with the mean 
    ( or median, or mode ) of that column.

3. Regression Imputation
    This approach replaces missing values with a predicted value based on a regression line.
    Regression is a statistical method which shows the relationship between a dependent variable 
    and independent variables. 
    
    It's expressed as [ y = mx + b ] where m is the slope, b is a constant, x is the 
    independent variable and y is the dependent variable.

4. Stochastic Regression Imputation
    This aims to preserve the variability of data. To achieve this, we add an error |
    (or residual term) to each predicted score. This residual term is normally distributed 
    with a mean of zero and a variance equal to the variance of the predictor used for imputing.


5. Multiply-Stochastic Regression Imputation
    This is similar to singly-stochastic regression imputation (i.e., where the missing values 
    in a given column are replaced with the predicted values based on a regression line and random error),
    but it is done for a few iterations and the final value is just aggregated by the mean.
